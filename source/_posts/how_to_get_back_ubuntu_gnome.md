title: How to get back Ubuntu Gnome with the new 17.10 version
---
As you may already know, the [Ubuntu Gnome distribution](https://ubuntugnome.org/) is terminated.
It is now replaced by Ubuntu himself that is now using Gnome-Shell as desktop.
The main drawback of Ubuntu is that it does not allow to install Gnome Extensions and comes with many specializations done by Canonical.

With the [latest 17.10 version of Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com/desktop/1710) that have been released yesterday it is not straightforward to figure out how to get a replacement of the Ubuntu Gnome distribution.  
Here is how you can proceed to get a vanilla Gnome like it was available in Ubuntu Gnome 17.04.

## Once Ubuntu 17.10 is installed you get the following screens
